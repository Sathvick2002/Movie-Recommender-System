# Movie-Recommender-System
  The main motive of this project is to construct a recommendation system for “Movies” using recommendation algorithms which uses the user data or entire user database, find the patterns in the items or datasets and recommend the content other than which is already in the playlist or watch list. The general pipeline of the recommendation system starts with data extraction followed by data processing and silting through the items based on their similarities and finally recommending. There are three types of recommendation system algorithms, "Content-based", “Collaborative”, and “Hybrid” models. The Hybrid model is focused in this report. This algorithm can be applied in OTT platforms, social media and in other applications. Movie Recommendation system also help users to find the movies of their choices based on the movie experience of other users in efficient and effective manner without wasting much time in useless browsing.
